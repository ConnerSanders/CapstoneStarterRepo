# Pulse Inverted Electrolyzer

## Executive Summary

 The Pulse Inverted Electrolyzer primary goal's are to boost the efficiency of the standard constant current electroylsis machine. A Standard Electrolysis sytem takes in constant current and turns an eletrolytic solution into gasses from said soluiton. The  Pulse Inverted Electrolyzer will boost efficiencies two ways. One will be by pulsing the current given to the electrodes, and the other by using consant magnetic fields to redirect ions back to the electrodes. By pulsing the current in an electrolyzer it takes adavantage of two ideas happening inside the water of the system. When first fired on the electrodes will gain electrons around, and prevent current to pass through. By pulsing the current the system allows for this layer to disperse to make for more current to flow through the electrolytic solution. Also by pulsing the current we will be able to send burst of energy through the system instead of the constant current normally supplied. The other way the system will boost efficiency will be using magents placed around the housing of the cell. This will basically push the electrons closer to the electrodes and further away from the cell walls. The system will also include a way to read the power the pulse inverter will be drawing and the amount of gas being outputted, to then calculate a efficency of the energy of the systems output versus its input. 

## Capabilities
The system will be divided into multiple systems that each have several expectations. The controller system should calculate the energy effienciecy based off the flowrate of the gas output and the current draw of pulse inverter. The safety system should any failed state go to a shutoff state. There will be a bypass for the user to be able to light the gas at the output of the gas system. The water system should automatically refill the cell with water when ever the system is too low.

## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.

###[Reports](/Reports)

The [Project Proposal](/Reports/Project%20Proposal/Project_Proposal-V2.pdf) report addresses key questions about the project. It states exactly what the problem is and what the solution plans to achieve. 

The [Conceptual Design and Planning](/Reports/Conceptual%20Design/Conceptual_DesignV2.pdf) report provides all specifications and constraints the project must follow. This includes standards and regulations that must be followed.

The [Experimentation](/Reports/Experimentation) report shows [finish later]

The [Poster](/Reports/Poster) is [finish later]

The [Final Report](/Reports/Final%20Report) includes [finish later]

The [Lessons Learned](/Reports/Lessons%20Learned/Lessons%20Learned.md) files shows all lessons learned throughout the process. It includes lessons in both team communication, project management, and technical knowledge.

### [Documentation](/Documentation)

All documentation is included in the above folder. Folders for the files including schematics and images are included in their respective folders. All files related to a specific signoff are then in a subfolder labeled appropriately.

Documentation include all schematics, images, models, and designs used in the project. 

The [Signoffs](/Documentation/Signoffs) folder houses all approved detail designs. These designs are for each subsystem and shows all constraints. The signoffs should convince the reader that all constraints are met as well as link to all other relevant documentation in their respective folders. These signoffs should also link any software in which is relevant.

The [Meeting Minutes](/Documentation/Meeting%20Minutes) folder contains dated minutes for all team meetings. This allows the reader to analyze current and previous progress in a time based manner. 


### Software
All software will be located in this directory. For each specific problem or system, a folder will be created that contains all relevant code along with a readme that explains installation, compiling, executing of the code.
