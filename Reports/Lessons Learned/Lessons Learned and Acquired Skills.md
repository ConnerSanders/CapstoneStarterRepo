# Lessons Learned

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document. 

# Wyatt Groves

- As a whole, I feel that the project went well on the more conceptual side of things. We managed to quickly and efficiently make designs and plans for what we were going to do moving forward. During some of the later parts of the project we didn't run quite as smoothly, as some sections could not get addressed in time for us to fix them.
- The sensors for the power and the flowrate are extremely finicky and we could never quite figure out how they worked, or if they were even working at all. This made trying to acquire numerical data for the efficiency very hard, which was frustrating.
- I would like to restructure the way that we worked and how we checked the progress of the other systems.
- It was good practice to always try to understand as much about the project as a whole as I could, so that I could help if another member was falling behind or needed assisstance. 
- Doing everything you can to make sure you get assignments done well before the deadlines was important. No matter how far ahead we got, I still feel like I need more time to do some work.
- Learning to work in a group like this is much different than a tyoical project group for a class. It felt more like how I imagine the real qorkforce is.
