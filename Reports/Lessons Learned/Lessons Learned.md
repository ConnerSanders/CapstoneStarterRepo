# Lessons Learned

## Brennan Angus
- Overall, the project went well. Organizationally, the team did what we were supposed to do and tended to do it in a timely manner. Communication tended to be lacking.
- One unanticipated problem was the need for adjusting capacitance values and working around impractical physical characteristics of components.
- If I were to do it again, I would take more initiative and push for more communication within the group. Better communication about individuals' and the whole group's progress could have served us well.
- Good practices included consultation of Professor Roberts for help when the team or I individually was unsure of how to approach an issue.
- I would emphasize the importance of getting everything done as efficiently (early and effectively) as possible. I would also emphasize the importance of initiative and honest communication.
- I learned how to approach design problems and take advantage of online research. I also improved my practical skills related to lab work.

## Matthew Beausoleil
- The conceptual side of the project was easier as it is just theory, and it's easier for everyone to collaborate. When it came to design, it got pretty crowded when more than three people had their hands in the box.
- For me, I was not anticipating the signal from the water sensor being inverted and the lack of documentation on the internal circuit, so there had to be some testing to see how the sensor work then re-design a circuit to work with the sensor.
- I have a terrible problem with not delegating work enough, and where I was better than past projects. I need to better as it left me pretty burnt out towards the end.
- I stand by our best practice of KISS "Keep it stupid simple". There is no need to make things overly complicated if it doesn't need to be.
- Try to front-load capstone so that when the final semester comes it's not a wall of assignments. 
- I feel like I can say I required my knowledge of Electronic design as I had to stare at several analog circuits and understand what was happening when they broke.

## Jacob Cooper
- I had a great time working on the project and I strongly feel we worked on this efficiently and as a team
- As we got into later parts of the project things did not run or work as intended and some sections didn't have enough time for us to solve them.
- Working in this sort of team was very beneficial for myself and learning how to cooperate smoothly with others. I believe everyone had a common goal and everyone got along well.
- I enjoyed how Jesse revered to us as engineers and it really felt like I was given a project just like how it will be in my future endeavours.
- For those future students, try to soak in the experience and don't treat it like a normal college project, consider it like a job.
- The biggest skills I acquired was simply working with a team and how to manage meetings outside class time. Also learning how to properly time management with this big project.
  
## Wyatt Groves

- As a whole, I feel that the project went well on the more conceptual side of things. We managed to quickly and efficiently make designs and plans for what we were going to do moving forward. During some of the later parts of the project, we didn't run quite as smoothly, as some sections could not get addressed in time for us to fix them.
- The sensors for the power and the flow rate are extremely finicky and we could never quite figure out how they worked, or if they were even working at all. This made trying to acquire numerical data for efficiency very hard, which was frustrating.
- I would like to restructure the way that we worked and how we checked the progress of the other systems.
- It was good practice to always try to understand as much about the project as a whole as I could so that I could help if another member was falling behind or needed assistance. 
- Doing everything you can to make sure you get assignments done well before the deadlines was important. No matter how far ahead we got, I still feel like I need more time to do some work.
- Learning to work in a group like this is much different than a typical project group for a class. It felt more like how I imagine the real workforce is.

## Austin Jerrolds

- Overall, I think we managed our technical assignments very well we were on top of deadlines never in crunch time. Once we got to the second half of the semester we were not organized very well and were not as on top of the project.
- We had some problems with sensors and components not functioning as intended and took a lot of troubleshooting.
- If I were to do it over again I would begin building as soon as I had parts. I would also spend a lot more time making sure that we designed as a team as opposed to having what seemed like 6 differently designed subsystems.
- I think it is best practice to be involved in the entire design process. The more you know about everyone's system and progress the smoother the project will go.
- My words of wisdom that I would pass on to future students is to communicate with your teammates as much as possible and to start working on any assignment or the building as soon as you can. Worst case scenario you finish the task early.
- I learned a lot about the entire project life cycle, especially in the technical phase. I think my writing has improved a lot and I've my eyes have been opened to things in the design process that I wouldn't have normally thought about.

## Conner Sanders

- I thought the project went well. Technically my system was simple, and I had minimal issues with designing and building. Organizationally, I think our team did a good job with the division of labor and time management. 
- Towards the end, components started failing or not acting as expected. This delayed the final build of the project and added some stress. 
- Putting more effort into building and testing earlier in the semester would relieve a lot of stress during crunch time.
- A "best practice" that I identified was consulting the team as a whole when I encountered any issue. It always helps to get different opinions and ideas when finding solutions.
- I would tell future students to do as mutch capstone work as possible, as soon as possible. Deadlines are not hard to meet, so long as you are actively working to meet them.
- Working with a larger team was both a challenge and a blessing in this scenario. It is sometimes hard to manage the division of labor and manage time with a team of this size. I think I got better at understanding what needs to be done, and how I can help meet deadlines, in a group setting.
