# Lessons Learned
## Matthew Beausoleil
- The conceptual side of the project was easier as it just theory, and its easier for everyone to collabaorate. WHen it came to design it got pretty crowded when more than three people had there hands in the box.
- For me, I was not anticapting the signal from the water sensor to be inverted and the lack of documentation on the interanl circuit, so there had to be some testing to see how the senor work then re-design a circuit to work with the sensor.
- I have a terrible problem with not delegating work enough, and where I was better than past projects. I need to better as it left me pretty burnt out towards the end.
- I stand by our best practice of KISS "Keep it stupid simple". There is no need to make things overly complicated if it doesn't need to be.
- Try to front load capstone, so when the final semester comes it's not a wall of asssignments. 
- I feel like I can say I reaqquired my knowledge of Electronic design as I had to stare at several analog circuit and understand what was happening when it broke.

- As a whole, I feel that the project went well on the more conceptual side of things. We managed to quickly and efficiently make designs and plans for what we were going to do moving forward. During some of the later parts of the project we didn't run quite as smoothly, as some sections could not get addressed in time for us to fix them.
- The sensors for the power and the flowrate are extremely finicky and we could never quite figure out how they worked, or if they were even working at all. This made trying to acquire numerical data for the efficiency very hard, which was frustrating.
- I would like to restructure the way that we worked and how we checked the progress of the other systems.
- It was good practice to always try to understand as much about the project as a whole as I could, so that I could help if another member was falling behind or needed assisstance. 
- Doing everything you can to make sure you get assignments done well before the deadlines was important. No matter how far ahead we got, I still feel like I need more time to do some work.
- Learning to work in a group like this is much different than a tyoical project group for a class. It felt more like how I imagine the real workforce is.

## Jacob Cooper
- I had a great time working on the project and I strongly feel we worked on this efficiently and as a team
- As we got into later parts of the project things did not run or work as intended and some sections didn't have enough time for us to solve them.
- Working in this sort of team was very beneficial for myself and learning how to cooperate smoothly with others. I believe everyone had a common goal and everyone got along well.
- I enjoyed how Jesse revered to us as engineers and it really felt like I was given a project just like how it will be in my future endeavors.
- For those future students, try to really soak in the experience and don't treat it like a normal college project, consider it like a job.
- The biggest skills I acquired was simply working with a team and how to manage meeting outside class time. Also learning how to properly time management with this big project.
