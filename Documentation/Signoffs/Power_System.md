# Power Subsystem

## Function of the Subsystem

This subsystem's purpose is to allow power supplied from a wall outlet to be used in our device.

| No. | Constraints                                                                         | Origin            |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | The system shall convert wall AC Voltage to DC voltage | Design Constraint |
| 2   | The system shall comply with NFPA 70, in reference to all wiring and power consumption| Design Constraint/ NFPA 70 |
| 3   | The subsystems shall not have fluctuations in voltage of greater or less than 10 volts compared to the rated voltage                          | Design Constraints |
| 4   | The system shall be able to power multpile different devices with different rated voltages | Design Constraint |
| 5   | The system shall be able to 5 VDC | Design Constraint |
| 6   | The system shall be able to 12 VDC | Design Constraint |
| 7   | The system shall have no dangerous exposed wires and shall be grounded as needed | OSHA 1910.304 - 305 and IEC 60950-1 Safety Standards |



<sup>1</sup> All components will be powered with DC inputs, ensuring the system is more easily buildable, and more consistent between subsystems.

<sup>2</sup> While not necessarily a contraint, it is good practice to be capable of supplying 1.2x more power than is expected to be drawn. This will account for some unexpected spikes in power draw that may otherwise cause a system failure.

| Device          | Voltage |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pulse Inverter (Capacitor Input)     | 12 V                    |
| Water Flow Valve             | 12 V                   |
| Water Flow Sensor             | 12 V                    |
| Pressure Sensor             | 12 V                   |
| Temperature Sensor |  5 V         |
| UV Sensor           | 5 V             |
| Power Sensor            |  5 V                  |
| Gas Flow Sensor           | 5 V                   |


The above table lists the rated voltages of each device.

<sup>3</sup> Different subsystems require different voltages. This will be accomplished by having 1 power supply supplying 12 VDC that is stepped down to 5 VDC using a buck converter.

<sup>4</sup>  A typical wall outlet will be used to power the device to avoid the issue of nonstandardized outlets needed to be present in the home of the user.

Pulse Inverter
The pulse inverter will be powered by 12 VDC and will have a power draw of 
~~~math
I_{Pulse Inverter} = P/V = (XW)/(12V) = XA
~~~

Water Flow Valve
The water flow valve will be powered by 12 VDC and will have a power draw of 18 W. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Water Flow Valve} = P/V = (18W)/(12V) = 1.5A
~~~

Water Level Sensor
The water level sensor will be powered by 12 VDC and will have a power draw of 60 mW. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Pulse Inverter} = P/V = (60mW)/(12V) = 5mA
~~~

Pressure Sensor
The pressure sensor will be powered by 12 VDC and will have a power draw of 96 W. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Pulse Inverter} = P/V = (96W)/(12V) = 8A
~~~

Temperature Sensor
The temperature sensor will be powered by 5 VDC and will have a power draw of 50 mW. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Pulse Inverter} = P/V = (50mW)/(5V) = 10mA
~~~

UV Sensor
The water level sensor will be powered by 12 VDC and will have a power draw of 680 nW. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Pulse Inverter} = P/V = (680nW)/(12V) = 136nA
~~~


Power Sensor
The power sensor will be powered by 5 VDC and will have a power draw of 1.55 mW. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Power Sensor} = P/V = (1.55mW)/(5V) = 310Î¼A
~~~

Gas Flow Sensor
The gas flow sensor will be powered by 5VDC and will have a power draw of 19 mW. This means the current draw is
~~~math
I_{Gas Flow Snesor} = P/V = (19mW)/(5V) = 3.8mA
~~~

The 12 VDC will be supplied by the SUPERNIGHT 110~240 VAC to 12 VDC.

The voltage regulation from 12 V to 5 V will be done by the Weewooday Direct Current Converter.

The supply will pull from a standard wall outlet (120 VAC) and will be wired into a 12 VDC power supply. The power supply will then be split into the buck converter circuit (which feeds the safety subsystem(s)), the water control circuit, and the pulse inverter circuit.

### Fulfilling Constraints




     

 The below equation was used for the power calculations for all devices.
~~~math
P = VI
~~~


### Power
(How much power is being used)

As mentioned previously, for the 12 V systems, the Alitove 5050 3528 Power supply will be used. This can support up to 5 A, which sould be more than enough to reliably power the system.

Again, for the 5 V systems, the Arndt 950-00143 Power supply will be used. This is a low power device, with a max current rating of 800 mA. As this is only supplying power to sensors. This should be sufficient to reliably power them.


### Input

The input for this subsystem is the 120 VAC coming from the wall outlet.

### Output


### Relay Coil

There will be a relay coil that is connected to the input of the 12 V transformer. This relay coil will be controlled by the safety subsystem, and will act as an emergency shutoff for the pulse inverter. The relay coil will receive a constant signal that allows the pulse inverter to operate. Should the signal ever not be present, the relay coil will not allow any power into the pulse inverter.
