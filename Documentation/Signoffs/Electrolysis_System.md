# Electrolysis System
## Function of the system
The role of the system is to implement the process necessary for generating the hydrogen and oxygen gases. The system consists of a pre-made electrolytic cell, a pulse inverter, a rectifier, and permanent magnets. The pulse inverter will be the power source of the system, and the rectifier will be used on the output of the pulse inverter to ensure that the polarity of the input power is consistent. The magnets will be used to boost the system's efficiency.

<sup>1</sup>
The material of the cell not being reactive with Potassium Hydroxide is essential both for functionality and safety, given that Potassium Hydroxide will be part of the solution housed in the cell.

<sup>2</sup>
This is a preference decided by the team.

<sup>3</sup>
The pulse generator will be the system's power source, and its frequency and amplitude will be manipulated for optimizing efficiency. The magnets will theoretically serve to bias the ions in the solution toward the electrodes in order to increase interaction and boost efficiency.

<sup>4</sup>
The rectification of the pulse generator's output, while not essential to the function of the system as it is being designed, is prefered as it makes possible future development more approachable. The direct purpose of the rectification is that it keeps the location of hydrogen and oxygen gas generation seperate so that, in the future, the gases can more easily be isolated from one another.

<sup>5</sup>
Hydrogen and oxygen gas will not be stored in the cell as pressurized storage of the gases results in a combustible system.

<sup>6</sup>
This will prevent any excessive delays that may be a safety concern.
