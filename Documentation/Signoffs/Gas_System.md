# Gas System
## Function of the system
The gas system plays an essential role in facilitating the electrolysis process, particularly in the context of collecting and handling the gases produced during electrolysis. This will be done with two arrestors and a torch to create a flame.

## Analysis

#### Gas Arrestor

In an electrolysis system, a gas arrestor, or gas trap, is a device used to capture and separate unwanted or hazardous gases produced during the electrolysis process. These gases may include volatile byproducts, impurities, or any potentially dangerous gases that need to be removed or trapped before they can escape into the surrounding environment. The gas arrestor works through a series of mechanisms to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the electrolysis system.

#### Electrolysis Flame Torch

The flame torch in this gas arrestor system serves a crucial role in ensuring the safe ignition of gases. Its primary function is to provide a controlled flame for initiating the combustion process. Designed with user safety in mind, the torch acts as a reliable source for igniting gases without the risk of unwanted combustion. Its integration into the system enhances the overall safety and efficiency of gas handling during the electrolysis process.

#### Gas Inlet and Outlet Valves

The gas inlet and outlet valves are pivotal components that regulate the flow of gases within the gas arrestor system. Configured for airtight sealing on the transparent container's lid, these valves facilitate controlled entry and exit of gases. The use of three valves allows for precise control over gas flow, ensuring safety and operational efficiency. Their construction from durable materials such as PVC or rubber enhances resistance to the handled gases, reducing the risk of leaks and ensuring a secure containment environment.

#### Tubing

The tubing in the gas arrestor system is a critical conduit connecting the gas inlet valve to the absorbent material at the bottom of the container. Constructed from PVC or rubber, the tubing is chosen for its resistance to the specific gases being handled. Its 1/4" diameter strikes a balance between efficient gas flow and controlled passage. The tubing's secure attachment to the gas inlet valve and placement within the container ensures a well-directed flow of gases through the absorbent material, optimizing the absorption and filtration process for enhanced safety and performance.
