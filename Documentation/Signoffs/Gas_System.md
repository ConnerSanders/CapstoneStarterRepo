# Gas System
## Function of the system
The gas system plays an essential role in facilitating the electrolysis process, particularly in the context of collecting and handling the gases produced during electrolysis. This will be done with two arrestors and a torch to create a flame.

## Analysis

#### Gas Arrestor

In an electrolysis system, a gas arrestor, or gas trap, is a device used to capture and separate unwanted or hazardous gases produced during the electrolysis process. These gases may include volatile byproducts, impurities, or any potentially dangerous gases that need to be removed or trapped before they can escape into the surrounding environment. The gas arrestor works through a series of mechanisms to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the electrolysis system.

#### Electrolysis Flame Torch

In an electrolysis system, a flame torch can be used for various purposes, depending on the specific requirements of the process. In an electrolysis system, a flame torch can be used for various purposes, depending on the specific requirements of the process.

##INSTRUCTIONS
Materials Needed:

Transparent or translucent plastic or glass container with a lid
Tubing (preferably made of a material resistant to the gas being handled, such as PVC or rubber)
Silicone sealant or epoxy glue
Gas outlet valve
Gas inlet valve
Activated carbon or absorbent material
Safety gloves and goggles
Steps to Make a Gas Arrestor:

Select a suitable container: Choose a transparent or translucent container that is large enough to hold the anticipated gas volume. Ensure that it has a tight-sealing lid that can be securely fastened.

Install the gas inlet and outlet valves: Drill holes in the lid of the container and attach the gas inlet and outlet valves securely using silicone sealant or epoxy glue. Make sure the valves are airtight to prevent any gas leakage.

Connect the tubing: Attach the tubing to the gas inlet valve and ensure it is securely fastened. The other end of the tubing should be placed at the bottom of the container to allow the gas to pass through the absorbent material.

Insert the absorbent material: Fill the bottom of the container with activated carbon or any suitable absorbent material. This will help trap and filter out any impurities or unwanted gases that pass through the system.

Secure the lid: Seal the container with the lid and ensure it is tightly closed to prevent any gas from escaping. Use additional silicone sealant or epoxy glue if necessary to ensure a secure seal.

Test for leaks: Before use, conduct a thorough leak test to ensure that the gas arrestor is airtight and that there are no potential leaks in the system. This step is crucial to prevent any hazardous situations during operation.

Install the gas arrestor in the desired location: Place the gas arrestor in a suitable location where it can effectively trap and handle the gases produced during the electrolysis process.
