# Controller System
## Function of the system

The goal of the system is to read the sensor values, compute the efficiency of the electrolyzer and output the rating to a display. The subsystem consists of a microcontroller that will perform the calculations, an energy metering IC to determine how much power the electrolyzer is using, and a flow rate sensor to determine gas content. The sensor readings and efficiency rating will then be output to a serial terminal where it can be viewed.
