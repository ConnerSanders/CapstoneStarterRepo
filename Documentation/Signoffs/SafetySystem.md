# Safety System
## Function of the system
This system will shut-off power to the pulse inverter if the system becomes unsafe, halting any gas production. The system consists of a flame detector, pressure sensor, temperature sensor, and an emergency stop button. Normally open relay contacts wwill be connected to all components previously mentioned. In the event that any of these contacts are closed, the relay coil will be deenergised, and power to the pulse inverter will be disconnected.
