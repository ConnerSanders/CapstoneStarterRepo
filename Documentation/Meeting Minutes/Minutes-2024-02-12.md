Week 4 - 30 minutes

Attendees: Brennan Angus, Matthew Beausoleil, Jacob Cooper, Wyatt Groves, Austin Jerrolds, and Conner Sanders

Started ordering and getting parts for Pulse Inverter. Talked to Van Neste about minimal functionality.

Group Decisions: Minimal functionality can be discussed and negotiated with Van Neste. We are aiming to have 
a working electrolysis machine and need all subsystems to be working properly but not at a fully complete
fuctional level.
