Getting parts for Pulse Inverter. Talked to Van Neste about minimal functionality. A lot of the group is done with their individual parts and we are getting ready to come together and test minimal functionality.

Group Decisions: Minimal functionality can be discussed and negotiated with Van Neste. We are aiming to have a working electrolysis machine and need all subsystems to be working properly.
